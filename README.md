The first step in the code is preprocessing the data into X, Y, and Z coordinates. This is done to ensure that the data is in a format that can be easily used for further analysis.

## Apply Windowing Function
Next, a windowing function is applied to the preprocessed data. This is done to smooth out any irregularities in the data and make it more suitable for modeling.

## Train Test Split
The preprocessed and windowed data is then split into training and testing sets. This is done to ensure that the model is trained on a subset of the data and tested on another subset, in order to prevent overfitting.

## Model Training and Evaluation
After the data has been split, a machine learning model is trained on the training set. The model is then evaluated on the testing set to determine its accuracy, f1-score and performance.

## Predictions for Subject 9 to 12
Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it is used to make predictions on a separate set of data corresponding to subjects 9 to 12.

## Verification of Shapes of Predictions
Finally, the shapes of the predictions made by the model are verified. This is done to ensure that the predicted values are in the correct format and can be easily interpreted for further analysis.

The Verified predictions are submitted for test scores.

Overall, the code in this file provides a comprehensive pipeline for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluating human activity recognition data.
